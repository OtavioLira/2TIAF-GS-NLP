João Pessoa City Hall's Environmental Crime Reporting Channels Operate 24/7
João Pessoa, Brazil - The João Pessoa City Hall, through the Environmental Protection Secretariat's (SEMAM) Inspection Division, provides several channels for the public to report environmental crimes, such as irregular sewage disposal, noise pollution, deforestation, and others. SEMAM offers the Disque Denúncia hotline: (83) 3213-7012, the Acácia chatbot, which can receive text, audio, and video messages via WhatsApp at (83) 3218-9208, and the João Pessoa na Palma da Mão app.

From January to April 2024, the SEMAM Inspection Division received 721 reports of environmental crimes. These include noise pollution, deforestation, dumping of sewage outside the collection system in various neighborhoods of the city, among others. Of the 721 reports received in the first four months of the year, 314 were for noise pollution, the infraction with the highest number of complaints. This was followed by other infractions (127), irregular sewage disposal (112), air pollution (107), deforestation (33), and 28 complaints of wastewater disposal (laundry and sink water dumped on open streets).

Regarding irregular sewage disposal, SEMAM's Inspection Division issued 26 infraction notices in various neighborhoods of the city. The law allows offenders to appeal these notices. Of these 26 notices, 7 were converted into warnings. An additional 37 notifications were issued for offenders to immediately cease sewage disposal.

The Environment Secretary, Welison Silveira, emphasized that the City Hall has been acting rigorously, punishing those who commit environmental infractions. "We follow all the procedures provided for in the legislation, applying penalties such as fines, embargoes, interdictions, notifications, and even suspending activities and revoking licenses. Establishments that are caught violating environmental and sanitary norms can only resume operations once they have proven to be regularized, following the norms," he stated.

Fines - The penalty for those caught dumping sewage irregularly can vary from 320 to 380 UFIRs (João Pessoa's Fiscal Reference Unit). In other words, it can vary from R$ 969.60 to R$ 18,422.40. The UFIR is currently R$ 48.48. The amount of the fine is determined according to the environmental damage.

SEMAM's Inspection teams are made up of professionals such as geographers, biologists, and environmental engineers. Two teams work daily, covering the city, one from 8 am to 7 pm and the other from 1 pm to midnight. As for noise pollution, reports can also be forwarded to the Military Police, as it is considered a disturbance of public peace, Article 42 of the Minor Offenses Law.
